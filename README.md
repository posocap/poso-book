## Code, Data and Visualizations

This repository contains code, data, and PowerPoint source files. JPEG and PNG versions of the plots are included in some cases. Most plots were originally created in Plot.ly and the associated code for those versions is contained within. Since the plots are published in non-interactive form, I ended up using PowerPoint in many cases. The underlying data remains the same for both plot types and users wishing to create variations of the plots may find the plot.ly code more convenient.

*viz.R* is the main code file for the non-economic components of the project. 

Some lines are commented out because they pertain to one-off installation of libraries through third party tools (e.g., Bioconductor, github installs, etc.) or plot.ly code that I ended up not using. 

## Comments
